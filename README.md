## Teambition Brand Assets
The etymology of the word "Teambition" is a combination of the two words, team and ambition.

Teambition is an easy and efficient way to work, by creating tasks, sharing posts and documents, keeping track of your calendar and checking everyone's progress.

This repository contains [the profiles](src/info.js) and [the visual assets](assets) which include:

- Logos and Doodles;
- SNS Avatars;
- App Icons and Favorites Icon.

## Installation
```
npm install --save tb-brand
```

## How to Use

### Import
So excited to tell you, the library [`tbrand`](src/index.js) supports [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) and ES6 Modules Definition.

When you use ES6 Modules to import tbrand, please make sure your build environment works with Webapck and [base64-loader](https://github.com/SuneBear/base64-loader).

If module is not found, use full path or support [`jsnext:main`](https://github.com/jsforum/jsforum/issues/5) to resolve.

### Usage
Honestly, tbrand is just a set of JSON data.

Debugging on a browser or having a look at [the examples directory](examples/browser) can help you to learn about all fields.

## Extra! Press Kit
We take design very seriously, so we also prepared perfect press kit for you.
